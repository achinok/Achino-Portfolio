    <p>Hi! I'm Kelly. I have a passion for web development, learning and team building. I am currently teaching myself HTML, CSS
      and Javascript. I will be learning wordpress among many other current programs.</p>
    <p>I am self taught. However, I have completed a front-end workshop with
      <em>Grand Circus Coding Bootcamps</em>. I will have finished an intensive front-end development program with
      <em>Grand Circus</em> as of June 29, 2018.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>I am located in Grand Rapids, MI.</li>
    <li>I attended Grand Circus's Intro to Coding Workshop in Detroit.</li>
    <li>I am now using ATOM and after a lot of feedback and research have figured out what packages I needed to install to make it run well for a moments so far have just been incredibly simple things like understanding that when you type out console.log you are essentially saying, "computer, speak back." </li>
  </ol>

  <br></br>

  <p> My favorite books include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Endurance</li>
      <li>The Screwtape Letters</li>
      <li>A Wrinkle in Time</li>
    </ul>
